## Welcome to CISC 5950 - Big Data Programming!

### Lecture 1
---

Thank you for a very enjoyable discussion last night! I will be using this site to post resources, links, lecture reviews, and homework assignments.

During our first lecture we spent time discussing the course [syllabus](Syllabus.pdf), including the grading breakdown for the course and the final project, as well as discussing how we might build out a data architecture for capturing user interactions from a Spotify-like music service. As we saw, it will be had to scale to more and more users and features without adding large amounts of complexity to our system. You'll have a chance to read more about these challenges in chapter 1 of the text.


Your homework assignment for next class is as follows:
  
  1. Please purchase the [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Principles-practices-scalable/dp/1617290343/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1502993183&sr=1-3&keywords=big+data) and read the Preface and Chapter 1. You'll have a chance to read in depth about the topics I covered in lecture last night. The author introduces the Lambda Architecture and discusses how the architecture is advantageous over the traditional relational database model.

  2. Spend time researching the specific technologies listed in section 1.8.3 of the text. Your final project will involve a group presentation of one of these technologies. Next class I will ask you to submit a ranked list of preferences for these technologies. Hence, it is in your best interest to understand them well enough to be able to tell me which you prefer to present on. Feel free to email me about other big data technologies if you have something you really wish to learn.

  3. Read [Part I of Spotify's 3-part blog piece on their Event Delivery system](https://labs.spotify.com/2016/02/25/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-i/). This is a great example of cutting edge industry work being done in the field of Big Data systems. In subsequent weeks I will ask you to read parts II and III. We will spend a fair amount of time this semester reading similar blog posts and papers introducing these technologies.

If anyone has any questions, please feel free to email me!
